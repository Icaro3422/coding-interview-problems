/**
 * Hackerrank
 * A queue is an abstract data type that maintains the order in which elements
 * were added to it, allowing the oldest elements to be removed from the front
 * and new elements to be added to the rear. This is called a First-In-First-Out
 * (FIFO) data structure because the first element added to the queue (i.e., the
 * one that has been waiting the longest) is always the first one to be removed.
 * 
 * In this challenge, you must first implement a queue using two stacks. Then
 * process q queries, where each query is one of the following  types:
 * 
 * 1 x: Enqueue element x into the end of the queue.
 * 2: Dequeue the element at the front of the queue.
 * 3: Print the element at the front of the queue.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 1. 1 <= q <= 10^5
 * 2. 1 <= type <= 3
 * 3. 1 <= |x| <= 10^9
 * 
 * This solution got 25 points
